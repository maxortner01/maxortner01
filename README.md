### Take a look at my projects!
Check out [my website](https://github.com/maxortner01/website), a recent project for [stock market back testing](https://github.com/maxortner01/simple-finance-library), or my endeavor for the Los Alamos National lab: [parallel-io](https://github.com/maxortner01/parallel-io). Other than that, I have many short-lived projects here, but most center around me learning ways to develop various performant software.

I have a [portfolio](https://github.com/maxortner01/portfolio), but *it is for my work from highschool*. For more up-to-date info, info check out [my website](https://www.maxortner.com)!

We are all here because we are passionate about something, for me it's about chasing that and using it to learn everything I possibly can about it. I hope I can demonstrate this passion to others through my work.

If you have anything to say, [contact me](mailto:contact@maxortner.com)!
